whenever you are creating a file and start of with the html....

1. make sure you empty the head tag <head> </head> and only leave the title which will be the title of the page
you are working on
2. once you do that go to views/components and open the header-tag.blade file
3. whatever you were to put inside the head tag you just deleted goes here
4. in the file containing the html... inside the head tag type in the following:
    <x-header-tag></x-header-tag>
    this will call the header-tag file which is a component

5. you might find i have done the same in a few more pages that already exist
6. corresponding tags have their own file hence you can view them in the components folder
