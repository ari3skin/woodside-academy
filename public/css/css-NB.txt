------------intructions to apply css files----------
there is a root css file called index.css
from there whatever other page you are styling should have its own css file
in the index.css is where we will be calling the other files
if you look in the header-tag.blade file under views/components is where i am calling the css index.css
this is to reduce the huge ammounts of code in one line
